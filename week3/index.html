                <br>LANGLEY, VA—A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General
revealed that the</br> CIA has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of
critical intelligence information with black <br>highlighters.</br>
            </p>

                <br>According to the report, sections of the documents— "almost invariably the most crucial
